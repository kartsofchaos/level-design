============================

Level design repository for the game [Karts of Chaos](https://github.com/kartsofchaos/game).

Directory structure
-------------------

To facilitate the work for the person who will be processing the level design and add it into Unity, the **finished** work should be copied into the appropriate root folder. Here is a brief explanation of the root folders:

- `maps` - Contains only **finished** maps.
- `personal/*` - Everyone has their own personal folder to store work-related data.
